          Tyrrell County is a sanctuary for nature enthusiasts. Step into the wild expanse of the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, where black bears roam and red wolves find refuge. Paddle the Scuppernong River, tracing the same waterways that Native Americans navigated centuries ago. Witness the dance of fireflies in Pettigrew State Park, where ancient cypress trees stand sentinel over the swamps. And for stargazers, our dark skies reveal constellations rarely seen elsewhere.
